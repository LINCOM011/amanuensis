# Amanuensis
The Amanuensis is meant to be an automated songwriting and recording system. To begin, simply open Amanuensis.maxpat and begin playing. There are only a few things you will probably want to set up the first time you use it:
- Specify a folder in which to save the final recordings and other project files.
- Point to your VSTi folder if you want to use MIDI instruments.
- Point to your drum sample folder if you want to play samples via MIDI.
- Select the appropriate audio driver if it has not already been found.
