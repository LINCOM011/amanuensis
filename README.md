# Amanuensis
The Amanuensis is meant to be an automated songwriting and recording system. To begin, simply open Amanuensis.maxpat and begin playing. It will automatically detect the best portions of your jam and create a cohesive song structure that will begin to loop around you and grow as you play. There are only a few things you will probably want to set up the first time you use it:
- Specify a folder in which to save the final recordings and other project files.
- Point to your VSTi folder if you want to use MIDI instruments.
- Point to your drum sample folder if you want to play samples via MIDI.
- Select the appropriate audio driver if it has not already been found.
